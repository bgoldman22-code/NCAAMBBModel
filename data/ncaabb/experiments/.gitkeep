# Longdog Calibration Experiments

This directory contains data for calibrating predictions on extreme underdog bets (+400 or higher).

## Files

- `variant_b_longdogs_raw.csv` - Raw longdog bets logged from production

### Data Columns:
- `date` - Game date
- `home_team` - Home team
- `away_team` - Away team
- `bet_side` - Side of longdog bet (home/away)
- `american_odds` - Odds (≥+400)
- `implied_prob_market` - Market's implied probability
- `model_prob` - Raw model probability (uncalibrated)
- `edge` - Raw edge
- `outcome` - Actual game outcome (1=win, 0=loss) - filled after game

## Purpose

These extreme underdogs are excluded from production picks but logged for research.
Once sufficient data is collected (50+ samples), we can:
1. Train Platt/Isotonic calibrators specifically for longdogs
2. Determine if any longdog ranges are profitable after calibration
3. Potentially expand the betting universe with calibrated longdog picks

## Status

**Accumulating data** - Need 50+ samples with outcomes before training calibrators.
